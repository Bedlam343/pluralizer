Pluraize nouns

A silly high school project that does the very laborious task of pluralizing nouns for you so you can better spend your precious time elsewhere...Although, be careful, it tends to get a couple of words wrong (which ones I forgot since this magnificient piece of code was put toegether in the long forgotten year of 2019). To take away something positive from this bug, now feature, is perhaps to recognize the dangers of absolute trust in humanly things...including humans.
